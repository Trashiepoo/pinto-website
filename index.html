    <h2>What is Muay Thai?</h2>
    <p>Muay Thai is referred to as “The Art of 8 Limbs”: using 8 points of contact- both hands, both elbows, both knees, and both shins to damage and/or injure your opponent. Muay Thai or Thai Boxing is the national sport and cultural martial art of Thailand and was developed several hundreds of years ago as a form of close combat during times of war.</p>
    <p>Today Muay Thai as a sport is becoming exceedingly popular on a global scale and has recently been accepted as an Olympic sport. Professional martial artists from all sides agree Muay Thai is essential to becoming an all-around multifaceted fighter. Watching a Muay Thai fight is truly a beautiful thing, there is a respected tradition throughout the whole event from the head pieces worn by fighters “Mongkon” to the “sealing of the ring” to the traditional and ritualistic dance “Wai Kru/Ram Muay” performed before the fight.</p>
    <p>Muay Thai is loved by many for its colorful and rich history and the way it unites the world in friendly competition. A beautiful display of basic techniques that are constantly practiced and put to the test makes this sport what it is. Nak Muays are always learning and evolving, and it is our job to help grow the sport of Muay Thai in America.</p>
